    "### Omitted variable bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the true model is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y = \\beta_1 X + \\beta_2 W + \\epsilon $$\n",
    "\n",
    "But we omit **w**, and estimate\n",

    "$$ y = \\beta_1 X + u $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathbb{E}[u | \\text{X}] \\neq 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simultaneity Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "This is when the both independent variable and target variable are simultaneously dependent on each other. There is no directionality of the dependence but we try to model in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let say we are trying to model students score in an exam based on the study hours the student put in the preparation. For this the model will be\n",

    "We know that there is monotonic relationship between exam score and the study hours. If the student study more hours its more likely to get high score. However, if the student expects the exam to be easy and get high score, the student may study for less hours. Therefore, there is a relationship between exam score and study hours both ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{score} \\leftrightarrow \\text{study_hours} $$\n",
